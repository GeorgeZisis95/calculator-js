## ⚙️ How It Works

Instead of using `eval()` or third-party libraries, the calculator uses a **homemade parser**:

1. User enters a mathematical expression.
2. Input is split into operands and operator.
3. The function evaluates the expression based on the detected operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc.).
